todo:
* better errors
* get rid of trailing zeros when printing floats
* should not treat exit as end of input

missing error types: 
* Overflow on a value or the result of an operation
* Underflow on a value or the result of an operation
* The program doesnâ€™t have an exit instruction is executed.
